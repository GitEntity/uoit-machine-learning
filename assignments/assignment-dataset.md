# Assignment 1: Datasets

For this assignment, you will use data collections methods similar to what was presented in class and in the [tutorial document](../tutorials/scraping/README.md).
You do not have to use a sports analytics dataset, but I have provided several [sports datasets](../datasets/sports.md) that you can use to get started.
If you had another dataset in mind (Twitter, IMDB, Steam) that you would like to collect from, feel free to do so.

### Goal

The goal of this assignment is to produce a github repository that I can clone easily, setup, and create a local copy of a subset of a dataset.
The data should come from a documented API, non-documented API, or from scraping a website.
The datasets that we are asking you to create would be relatively useful in a machine learning concept.
Envision a scenario where you would use this data for prediction, unsupervised learning, etc.

### Requirements

1. The code for the entire project is hosted on a Github repository (or bitbucket).
2. A README file is provided with the proper instructions for setup.
3. Reproducability is featured in the setup instructions, which includes but is not limited to:
  - docker containers
  - virtual environments
  - user defined python packages
4. Data is saved to a database(can be SQL or NoSQL) or to a local data file(csv).

`Marking 4/4 Requirements = 100%`

### Important

Just downloading a csv file with already curated data like from a site like [this](https://github.com/sealneaward/nba-movement-data) is not acceptible for this assignment.
We want to create a 'new' dataset for machine learning.

It is not necessarily mandatory yet to use programming languages that are useful for machine learning(Python, R), but this excersize is a great way for you to learn them, as you will need to learn them for future assignments.
