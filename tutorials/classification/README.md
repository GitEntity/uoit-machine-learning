# Machine Learning Presentation

The [following](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTbqcL77yVsQNvAK1l3WExi-3byuucwBOW4rc2MmXiNMgsmUe0fxXhbZP2WSLl_EHh2k5CLlV-fxCba/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000) is a presentation that goes through different supervised and unsupervised learning methods. The presentation includes the different evaluation metrics as well as demo jupyter notebooks you can explore with your own time. The workshop is a more detailed version of using machine learning and data cleansing as tools for classification.

# Machine Learning Workshop

The following is a Machine Learning Workshop (sourced from [@gnu-user](https://github.com/gnu-user/ml-workshop)), include presentation materials and a step-by-step walkthrough of the data science and Machine Learning process often involved in applying it to problems.

In order to get started you will need to have Python installed and have all of the required dependencies installed, which are provided in the `requirements.txt` file.

You can install everything with a simple.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To open the jupyter notebook, you simply enter this command.
```
